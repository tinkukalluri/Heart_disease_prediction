        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) and heart defects you’re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          The term “heart disease” is often used interchangeably with the term “cardiovascular disease”. Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart’s muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
           Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data analysis. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge. Data mining turns the large collection of raw healthcare data into information that can help to make informed decisions and predictions.

          <p style='color:skyblue;font-family: sohne, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>
            About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year–that’s 1 in every 4 deaths.
          </p>
          <p style='color:skyblue;font-family: sohne, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>
            Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. More than half of the deaths due to heart disease in 2009 were in men.
          </p>
          <p style='color:skyblue;font-family: sohne, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>
            Coronary Heart Disease(CHD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 people annually.
          </p>
          <p style='color:skyblue;font-family: sohne, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>
            Every year about 735,000 Americans have a heart attack. Of these, 525,000 are a first heart attack and 210,000 happen in people who have already had a heart attack.
          </p>

        <br/>
        <p>
          This makes heart disease a major concern to be dealt with. But it is difficult to identify heart disease because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, and many other factors. Due to such constraints, scientists have turned towards modern approaches like Data Mining and Machine Learning for predicting the disease.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
Machine learning (ML) proves to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry.        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
        In this Application, I will be applying Machine Learning approaches(and eventually comparing them) for classifying whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not, using one of the most used dataset — Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Repository.
