# Heart Disease Prediction using ML [link to AWS EC2 instance running application](http://3.18.103.42/)
### In this application, we will be applying machine learning approaches (and eventually comparing them) for classifying whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not, using one of the most widely used datasets, the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Repository.

Tech-stack: pandas, sklearn, Matplotlib, Django framework, Python for backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend Development.

Features:
- Users can create accounts and log in safely with user registration and login.
- Determine whether they have any heart conditions.
- We can make predictions using a variety of machine learning algorithms.
- The user can choose among Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, and Neural Networks as their prediction model.
- Save your clinical parameters to your account after entering them.
